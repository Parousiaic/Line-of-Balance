Course Reminders
-------------------

Github doesn't render mathjax by default so you won't be able to see the mathematical equations if I included them in this readme. I have instead included a "readme.html" file which you can open in your browser on your computer.

You may also use view the same equations in the accompanying "readme.ipynb" jupyter notebook.

Known parameters - scalars
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

1. Number of sections to produce
2. Buffer time
3. Desired output rate
4. Hours of work per day
5. Days of work per week

Known parameters - sequences
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

1. Activity names
2. Manhours per unit required for each activity
3. Number of men per gang for each activity

Parameters to be calculated
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

1. Theoretical gang size required to complete each activity
2. Actual gang size required for each activity.
3. Actual output rate for each activity
4. Duration to complete a unit of each activity (activity duration per unit)
5. Time from start on first section to start on last section of each activity. This could also be interpreted as the time from end of first section to end of last section
6. Time of start on first section for each activity
7. Time of end on first section for each activity
8. Time of start on last section for each activity
9. Time of end on last section for each activity
